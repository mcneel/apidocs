<dt>int Archive3dmVersion</dt>
<dd>If a 3dm archive is being read or written, then this is the
version of the 3dm archive format (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5).
0     a 3dm archive is not being read/written
1     a version 1 3dm archive is being read/written
2     a version 2 3dm archive is being read/written
3     a version 3 3dm archive is being read/written

5     an old version 5 3dm archive is being read
50    a version 5 3dm archive is being read/written.</dd>
<dt>ulong CurrentPosition</dt>
<dd>current offset (in bytes) into archive ( like ftell() )</dd>

<dt>bool ReadErrorOccured</dt>
<dd>Gets or sets whether en error occurred during reading.</dd>

<dd>True if at end of a file</dd>
<dd>since 5.1</dd>
<dt>bool BeginRead3dmChunk(uint expectedTypeCode,int majorVersion,int minorVersion)</dt>
<dd>Begins reading a chunk that must be in the archive at this location.</dd>
<dd>Returns - True if beginning of the chunk was read.  In this case you must call EndRead3dmChunk(),
even if something goes wrong while you attempt to read the interior of the chunk.
False if the chunk did not exist at the current location in the file.</dd>
<dd>since 6.0</dd>
<dt>bool BeginRead3dmChunk(uint typeCode,long value)</dt>
<dd>Begins reading a chunk that must be in the archive at this location.</dd>
<dd>since (unknown)</dd>
<dt>uint Dump3dmChunk(TextLog log)</dt>
<dd>Fnction for studying contents of a file.  The primary use is as an aid
to help dig through files that have been damaged (bad disks, transmission
errors, etc.) If an error is found, a line that begins with the word
&ldquo;ERROR&rdquo; is printed.</dd>
<dd>Returns - 0 if something went wrong, otherwise the typecode of the chunk that
was just studied.</dd>
<dd>since 5.1</dd>
<dt>bool EnableCRCCalculation(bool enable)</dt>
<dd>Expert user function to control CRC calculation while reading and writing.
Typically this is used when seeking around and reading/writing information
in non-serial order.</dd>
<dd>Returns - Current state of CRC calculation.  Use the returned value to restore the
CRC calculation setting after you are finished doing your fancy pants
expert IO.</dd>
<dd>since 6.0</dd>
<dt>bool EndRead3dmChunk(bool suppressPartiallyReadChunkWarning)</dt>
<dd>Calling this will skip rest of stuff in chunk if it was only partially read.</dd>
<dd>since 6.0</dd>
<dt>void Read3dmChunkVersion(int major,int minor)</dt>
<dd>A chunk version is a single byte that encodes a major.minor
version number.  Useful when creating I/O code for 3dm chunks
that may change in the future.  Increment the minor version 
number if new information is added to the end of the chunk. 
Increment the major version if the format of the chunk changes
in some other way.</dd>
