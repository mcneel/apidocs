      <description>Namespace: Rhino.Geometry.Intersect
Maintains an ordered list of Curve Intersection results.
public class CurveIntersectionsProperties int Count  (summary) Gets the number of recorded intersection events. (since) 5.0  Methods void CopyTo(IntersectionEvent[] array,int arrayIndex)  (summary) Copies all intersection results into another array, departing at an index in the target array. (since) 5.0 (returns) void This is some return comment  void Dispose()  (summary) Actively reclaims unmanaged resources that this instance uses.</description>

      <description>Namespace: Rhino.Geometry.Intersect
Provides static methods for the computation of intersections, projections, sections and similar.
public class IntersectionProperties static double MeshIntersectionsTolerancesCoefficient  (summary) Offers a requested adjustment coefficient for mesh-mesh intersections tolerances. The value can be used to multiply the document absolute tolerance.This is only a UI value; it is up to developer to honor (or not) this request, depending on application needs. (since) 7.0  Methods static bool BrepBrep(Brep brepA,Brep brepB,double tolerance,Curve[] intersectionCurves,Point3d[] intersectionPoints)  (summary) Intersects two Breps.</description>

      <description>Namespace: Rhino.Geometry.Intersect
Provides all the information for a single Curve Intersection event.
public class IntersectionEventProperties bool IsOverlap  (summary) All curve intersection events are either a single point or an overlap. (since) 5.0  bool IsPoint  (summary) All curve intersection events are either a single point or an overlap. (since) 5.0  Interval OverlapA  (summary) Gets the interval on curve A where the overlap occurs. If the intersection type is not overlap, this value is meaningless.</description>

      <description>Namespace: Rhino.Geometry.Intersect
Represents a particular instance of a clash or intersection between two meshes.
public class MeshClashProperties Point3d ClashPoint  (summary) If valid, then the sphere centered at ClashPoint of ClashRadius distance intersects the clashing meshes. (since) 5.0  double ClashRadius  (summary) Gets the clash, or intersection, radius. (since) 5.0  Mesh MeshA  (summary) Gets the first mesh. (since) 5.0  Mesh MeshB  (summary) Gets the second mesh.</description>

Represents an element which is part of a curve region boundary.
Properties Point3d[] HitPoints  (summary) Array of hit points where the objects of IndexA and IndexB interfere. (since) 7.0  int IndexA  (summary) The index of the first clashing, or interfering object. (since) 7.0  int IndexB  (summary) The index of the second clashing, or interfering object.
